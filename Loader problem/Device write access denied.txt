Well, I reproduced this situation.

You can check the offset of the first partition using the command line:
DISKPART
LISt DISk
SELect DISk * (use appropriate disk number here)
SELect PARtition 1
DETail PARtition ("Offset in Bytes" is the value you are interested in)
EXIt

Offset 1048576 bytes is the default for 8 GB and larger devices, partitioned using Windows. This offset leaves about 1 MB of free space for oscilloscope firmware.
But if Windows formats an already partitioned device with less free space, it DOES NOT CHANGE the existing offset. You need to delete the partition and create it again.

Command line way:
DISKPART
LISt DISk
SELect DISk * (use appropriate disk number here)
CLEar
CREate PARtition PRImary
EXIt

Disk Manager way:
Find your card, right click on partition, select "Remove Volume", confirm.
One more right click, select "New Single Volume", next, next, next... You may leave everything as default.

After creating the partition, you need to format it as FAT32. Then use my loader, it should work without errors.
Please note that the default offset for 1..4 GB devices is 65536, so there will not be enough space for oscilloscope firmware without special repartitioning.

I think I should at least add a check for "hidden" free space on the SD, what do you think?
