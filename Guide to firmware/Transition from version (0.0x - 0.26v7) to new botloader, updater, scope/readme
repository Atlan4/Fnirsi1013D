If you have an older version of alternative firmware installed (ideally v0.26v to 0.26v7). Use the loader 1.1.3 program and upload the fnirsi_1013d migration.bin firmware to the oscilloscope. BEFORE that, it is MANDATORY to ENABLE booting with the option to select the startup (PECO, FEL mode, FNIRSI) in the oscilloscope menu.
Then turn on the oscilloscope and select the UPDATE option.
The program will start, which allows you to move-copy files to the oscilloscope's SD card. And from there, upload them to the oscilloscope's SD card using the UPLOAD button.
