No one is responsible for anything, you do everything at your own risk.

1. FPGA AL3S10 directory with project - Anlogic TD
2. fpga-1013D-1-zb25vq80.bin - original FNIRSI FPGA firmware for SPI flash
3. FPGA.bin - custom firmware for FPGA SPI flash

IMPORTANT: bootloader v0.8 or higer.

For programing SPI flash use CH341 with 3.3V converter
